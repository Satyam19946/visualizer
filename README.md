Completed -

- PathFinding Algorithms
  1. Depth First Search
  2. Breadth First Search
  3. Dijkstra's (Uniform Cost Search) Algorithm
  4. A\*

In Progress -

- Sorting Algorithms
  1. Bubble Sort - Bubble the largest to the end in first iteration. Bubble the second largest to the end in the second iteration and so on... untill the whole array is sorted.
  2. Merge Sort
  3. Quick Sort

Pushed Trees for later (need help on css)

- Trees
  1. Binary Search Trees
  2. Tree Traversals and their uses (w/ Leetcode Problems)
     - Level Order
     - Pre-Order
     - Post-Order
     - In-Order

Planned -

- Linked List
- Hash Maps
